# Logic Simulator
 
This Project is a part from Si-Vision ESW internship. Logic Simulator is a c++ console application that simulates all the gates used in logic projects, simulate a whole circuit and different combinations of gates together and gives the result accurately. 
**User Manual**
-write the gate following by the two input nodes and the output node (e.g. AND A B C)
- After entring all the connections write the nodes setup and unsetted node will be zero by default. (e.g. SET A 0)
- Write SIM to start simulation
- Write OUT ALL to view all nodes values or OUT (gate name) to view the gate
